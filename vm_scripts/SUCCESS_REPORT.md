## 🔧 Technical Challenges Resolved

### 1. Memory Optimization
**Challenge:** CUDA Out of Memory errors with original settings
**Solution:** 
- Reduced `per_device_train_batch_size` from 16 → 2
- Reduced `max_length` from 2048 → 1024
- Maintained total batch size through gradient accumulation

### 2. Compatibility Issues
**Challenge:** Import errors with newer transformers API
**Solutions Applied:**
- Fixed Flash Attention imports with fallback implementation
- Updated cache utilities to use available API methods
- Applied patches for model loading compatibility

### 3. Environment Setup
**Challenge:** Limited disk space and system constraints
**Solution:**
- Used `/var/home` directory (5.7TB available)
- Installed Python 3.9 compatible versions
- Skipped system-wide updates to conserve space

### 4. Distributed Training
**Challenge:** DeepSpeed compilation issues
**Solution:**
- Disabled DeepSpeed configuration
- Used Accelerate with DDP for multi-GPU training
- Maintained training efficiency across 4 GPUs
