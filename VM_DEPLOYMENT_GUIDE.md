## 🎯 Quick Start (3 Commands)

```bash
# 1. Set your VM details
export VM_HOST="root@your-vm-hostname"

# 2. Deploy to VM
cd mixture_of_recursions/vm_scripts
bash deploy_to_vm.sh

# 3. Follow the setup instructions displayed
```

## 🎮 Local Inference (Ready to Use!)

The trained model has been copied locally and is ready for inference:

```bash
# Interactive chat mode
cd vm_scripts
python local_inference.py --interactive

# Single prompt generation
python local_inference.py --prompt "Explain quantum computing" --max_length 150

# Demo mode (sample prompts)
python local_inference.py
```

## 📊 Training Results Summary

| 🎯 **TRAINING COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY** |
|------|
| **Duration:** 2 days, 16+ hours |
| **Loss Reduction:** 7.20 → 2.88 (60% improvement) |
| **Model Size:** 261M parameters |
| **Hardware:** 4x NVIDIA L40S GPUs |
| **Checkpoints:** 11 saved checkpoints |

## 🔐 Security Notice

⚠️ **VM credentials have been removed** from all scripts for security:
- Scripts now use environment variables: `VM_HOST`, `REMOTE_DIR`
- No hardcoded hostnames or credentials
- Safe for version control and sharing
